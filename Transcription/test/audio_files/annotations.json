                "transcription": "1. The sole accused stands trial on a complaint filed u/s 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the NI Act) , alleging to have committed an offence punishable u/s 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. 2. Quintessence of the averments in the complaint runs as follows : The complainant is the proprietor of the concern by name M/s Namson Druglines. The accused is the owner of a medical whole sale business namely New Life Pharma, The accused was a regular purchaser of medicines from the complainant. The accused purchased medicines on credit for a total cost of Rs.1,99,094/\u00ad (Rupees One Lakh Ninety Nine Thousand and Ninety Four Only) from the complainant and the accused has not effected payment promptly. On the failure of effecting payment to the complainant, the accused had issued a cheque bearing no 10093882 dated 30.07.2019 drawn on M/s Federal Bank Ltd Adimali Branch for Rs.1,99,094/\u00ad (Rupees One Lakh Ninety Nine thousand and Ninety Four Only) towards the discharge of the amounts due from the accused to complainant. At the time of issuance of the said cheque, the accused made the complainant to believe that, there is sufficient funds in his account and that the cheque will be honoured as and when presented. Believing the words of the accused, the complainant presented the cheque bearing No.093882 dated 30.07.2019 drawn on M/s Federal Bank Ltd, Adimali Branch for Rs,1,99,094/\u00ad (Rupees One lakh Ninety Nine thousand and Ninty Four Only) for encashment through the complainant's bank M/s Federal Bank Ltd, Vyttila Branch. But the said cheque was returned as unpaid for the reason of \u201cFunds Insufficient\u201d and a cheque return memo dated 04.09.2019 was issued to the effect by the said bank, Adimaly Branch. After receiving the cheque return memo, complainant caused to issue lawyer notice dated 18.09.2019 , to the accused, in both his house address and to his shop named New Life Pharma informing about the dishonour of the cheque and demanding payment within 15 days from the date of receipt of the said notice. The registered legal notice issued to the house address of the accused was acknowledged and signed by the accused dated not ( Served by post office on 20.09.2019) and the registered legal notice send to the shop address of the accused was returned unclaimed. Thereafter the accused has send a reply notice though his counsel. The accused has so far not settled the dispute regarding dishonour of cheque. On a conspectus of the afore stated factual antecedents, the accused is alleged to have committed an offence punishable u/s 138 r/w 142 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. Ergo, this complaint was necessitated. 3. The lament of the accused is that the accused does not owe any amount to the complainant as alleged in the complaint. The specific defence of the accused is that the impugned cheque is that signed blank cheque which the accused had entrusted with the complainant as a security towards the business transaction and the same was misused by the complainant by filling it up with an amount which is double the value of the expired medicines which were supplied to the accused. The accused seeks exoneration accenting on this defence. 4. On a bare\u00adglance of the available documents on record, it was prima facie perceptible that the accused has committed an offence punishable u/s 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, therefore, cognizance for the said offence was taken by my learned predecessor. Upon taking cognizance, process was issued to the accused. On appearance, the accused was enlarged on bail with sufficient sureties and was duly furnished with a copy of the complaint complying the procedural mandate envisaged under the Code of Criminal Procedure. Subsequently, the particulars of the offence u/s 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act was read over and explained to the accused in the vernacular known to him, to which she pleaded not guilty and pressed to contest the matter. 5. Considering the nature of transaction and the hefty sum of money involved in the case, this court finds it apt and befitting to switch over to summons trial from summary trial. To bolster the case of the complainant, the the complainant himself got examined as PW1 and Ext P1 to Ext P9 were marked through him. After the closure of the evidence of the complainant, the matter was taken for the examination of the accused u/s 313(1) (b) of Code of Criminal Procedure, whereupon the accused ardently denied all the incriminating circumstances tendered in evidence against him by the complainant. Thereupon, the matter was posted for defence evidence. No evidence put fourth by the accused to hammer home his defence. 6. Heard In extenso. I have bestowed my thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsels on both sides. 7. In the light of the rival submissions made by the parties and the available evidence on record, the following points arise for determination for the proper adjudication of the case:\u00ad 1) Did the accused issue and execute Ext P1 cheque in discharge of a legally enforceable debt ? 2) Did the accused commit an offence punishable u/s 138 of the Negotiable Instrument act ? 3) If the accused is found guilty , what ought to be the punishment? 8. Point No 1 and 2 : Considering the factual antecedents of the case and to bypass recurrence, all these points are determined en masse. The complainant is represented by its proprietor and it was he who had filed the affidavit in lieu of chief examination under sec 145(2) of the Act, wherein he has rehashed the averments in congruence with that of the complaint. According to PW1, the accused is known to him who is running a medical wholesale business in the name and style ' New Life Pharma' and a regular purchaser of medicines from the complainant. PW1 asserted that the accused had executed and issued Ext P1 bearing number 10093882 for an amount of Rs.1,99,094/\u00ad dated 30.07.2019 drawn on the Federal Bank Ltd, Adimali Branch towards the discharge of the amount due to the complainant with respect to the supply of medicines. According to the PW1, the nature of transaction between the accused and him was on credit basis upon which the accused had made an assurance that the said amount will be repaid as and when demanded by the complainant. However, on presentment, Ext P1 was dishonoured for the reason \" Funds Insufficient \" along with Ext P2 dishonour memo. Thereupon, the accused was apprised with Ext P3 legal demand notice intimating the accused regarding the dishonour of Ext P2 and directing them to repay the amount covered by the cheque with a span of 15 days from the receipt of the same. While in the event of cross examination, PW1 deposed that the alleged transaction in question with the accused took place during the relevant year 2018\u00ad2019. According to PW1, the nature of transaction with the accused was in such a manner that the executives of the complainant would supply medicines to the accused, however, PW1 avowed that he could not recollect the name of the executive who had supplied medicines to the accused for the reason that the transaction actually took place before three years. The learned defence counsel had putforth a suggestion to the effect that the accused had repaid the amount for the value of medicines supplied to him except for those medicines which were expired, towards which PW1 responded in negative.",

                "transcription": "Furthermore, PW1 added that the medicines supplied to the accused falls in the category of generic medicines and that refund is not allotted when generic medicine gets expired. PW1 had also responded in negative to the suggestion posed by the learned defence counsel to the effect that, Ext P1 is that security cheque which the complainant had misused by filling it up with an amount which is double of the expired medicines which were supplied by the complainant to the accused during the course of their business. PW1 conceded that Ext P1 is that security cheque which the accused had entrusted with the complainant during the course of their business on a promise that it can be presented in discharge of the debts that occur in course of business transaction between them. Despite all these, i t is worth to note that, the accused has not disputed his signature on Ext P1 till the fag end of the trial and that he has no dissension as to the fact that Ext P1 is not drawn from his bank account . At this juncture, it is apposite to cite the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Rangappa Vs Sri Mohan [2010(2) KLT 682], wherein the court manifested that \" Once the cheque relates to the account of the accused and when he accepts and admits his signature on the said cheque, the initial presumption under sec 139 and 118 of the Act has to be raised by the court in favour of the complainant .\" 9. In the matter at hand, the oral and documentary evidence putforth by the complainant before the court is fully corroborated with each other. It can be, therefore, safely held that the complainant has initially discharged the burden casted upon him to establish the ingredients of sec 138 of the Act so as to nail the guilt of the accused. On a conspectus of the evidence of the complainant, this court finds that the factum of execution is fully established. Once the factum of execution is established, the presumptions under sec 139 and 118 of the Act begins to run in favour of the complainant. Now the ball lies in the court of the accused to rebut the said presumption. 10. Inorder to rebut the presumptions casted upon the shoulders of the accused, the accused chose to point out the discrepancies and dents in the case of the complainant. 11. Let us now meticulously evaluate the arguments advanced by both parties at length. The primary defence raised by the learned defence counsel is that Ext P1 was issued as a security to the complainant and the same was misused by the complainant by filling it up wrongful entries which is double the amount of the expired medicines. In this regard, on a perusal of the oral evidence of PW1, while in the event of cross examination, PW1 conceded that Ext P1 was issued as a security by the accused with a prior permission to present the same towards the discharge of documents in their business transaction. Though PW1 has produced Ext P9 invoices raised by the complainant in the name of the proprietorship of the accused, the same cannot be read in evidence, for the reason that the said document, being computer generated, is not supported by a certification as mandated by section 65 B of the Indian Evidence Act. However, it is beyond cavil that since the accused did not dispute his signature on Ext P1 and that he has no difference of opinion regarding the fact that Ext P1 does not belong to his bank account, the presumptions under Section 118 and 139 of the Act runs in favour of the complainant, particularly that presumption which arises u/s 118 (a) of the Act that Ext P1 was made or drawn for consideration. In the matter at hand, though the accused posed by way of suggestion that he has discharged the outstanding which was due to the complainant except the value of the expired generic medicine, the accused did not putforth any piece of evidence to reinforce his claim of discharge. Furthermore, the accused had not place any reliable piece of evidence to buttress his claim that the complainant had supplied expired generic medicines to him. The only contention of the accused is that Ext P1 was a security which was issued to the complainant during the course of business between the PW1 and the accused. Even if the claim of the security cheque is taken into account, in that regard this court would rely on the judgment rendered by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court Bir singh Vs Mukesh Kumar [ 2019 SC 2446 ] , wherein the court reiterated and made the point lucid that \" When the accused admits the signature in the cheque , it is immaterial as to whether some person has made the entries in the cheque or filled it up. Even if some other person had filled up the cheque , it does not in any way affect the validity of the cheque\". Furthermore, a meaningful reading of the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act including, in particular, Sections 20,87 and 139, makes it amply clear that a person who signs a cheque and makes it over to the payee remains liable unless he adduces evidence to rebut the presumption that the cheque had been issued for payment of a debt or in discharge of a liability. It is immaterial that the cheque may have been filled in by any person other than the drawer, if the cheque is duly signed by the drawer. If the cheque is otherwise valid, the penal provisions of Section 138 would be attracted. If a signed blank cheque is voluntarily presented to a payee, towards some payment, the payee may fill up the amount and other particulars. This in itself would not invalidate the cheque. The onus would still be on the accused to prove that the cheque was not in discharge of a debt or liability by adducing evidence. What can be culled out from the afore precedent when applied to the factual matrix of this case is that, even if a signed blank cheque is issued to the complainant, if the accused admits the signature on the said cheque, it is immaterial as to who had filled up the entries on the cheque, if the complainant could prove that the cheque so issued was executed and issued for a consideration. In the present case, the complainant could initially discharge its burden that Ext P1 was executed and issued by the accused in discharge of the dues with respect to the supply of medicines. However, though the learned defence counsel vehemently contended the claim of discharge, the accused has not placed any piece of evidence to reinforce the same. Hence, the upshot of the afore discussion is that the defence of the accused that Ext P1 was only a security cheque issued by the accused during the course of business between the complainant and the accused and hence a manipulated piece of evidence is not legally sustainable, the accused could not rebut the presumption running in favour of the complainant either by way of showing that the debt did not exist or that under the particular circumstance of the case the non existence of consideration and debt is so probable that a prudent man ought to suppose that no consideration and debt existed. Hence, this court finds nothing to disbelieve the claim of the complainant that Ext P1 was executed and issued by the complainant in discharge of a debt as alleged in the complaint for the reason that the oral evidence corroborates the documentary evidence adduced by the complainant.",

                "transcription": "12. Apart from a bald and bare denial to the asseverations of the complaint in the instant matter, the accused could not advance any cogent and plausible explanation and placed evidence on record to convince the court as to how his cheque which bears his signature happened to be in the possession of the complainant, and the defence upraised by him is not reliable and trustworthy. On a careful dissection of the evidence tendered by PW1 from stem to stern, nothing is elicited from them so as to shatter the foundation of the case and thereby embrace the version of defence. Hence , the court is of the firm opinion that the defence side could not raise a probable and plausible version to outweigh the case of the prosecution. Having considered the entire evidence on record, this court finds that the complainant is entitled to bank upon the presumption under section 118 and section 139 of the Act. There is not even a single shred of evidence placed by the accused to rebut the same. The evidence adduced by the complainant and the presumption which stands in her favour are sufficient to hold that the cheque is question is one which is drawn and issued by the accused in discharge of the liability as alleged . 13. There is no dispute regarding due compliance of the statutory procedural mandates as required by the complainant to fulfil. Even otherwise, going by the evidence put forth by the complainant in his Proof affidavit , it has been proved that the statutory procedural mandates are duly complied with by the complainant. Ergo, Point Nos 1&2 are answered in favour of the complainant. 14. Point No: 3 :\u00adSequel to my findings on Points No 1 to 2 , the accused is found guilty of the offence punishable under sec 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act and he is convicted hereunder. Though the offence under sec 138 is in the nature of a civil wrong which is wrapped up in criminal overtones , I find no reason to award an imprisonment for a period less than 3 months in violation of the mandate envisaged under sec 354(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure ,1973. In adherence to the decision rendered by the Hon\u2019ble High Court of Kerala in Nalinakshan M.V Vs V.M.Ramesan and Another (2009(1)KLT 556), the salubrious provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act is not invoked in favour of the accused. In the light of the edict laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Vijayan Vs Baby (AIR 2012 SC 528) , and decorously appraising the factual antecedents of this cases, I find it appropriate and reasonable to award a simple interest of 9% per annum as the reasonable quantum of loss sustained by the complainant. In the instant case, the cheque is dated 30.07.2019. Three years and Three months have elapsed by now. Interest rate at 9% for a period of Five years would arrive at 58,234/\u00ad(Fifty Eight thousand Two hundred and\u20b9 Thirty Four Rupees Only). Then the aggregate would come up to 2,57,328/\u00ad\u20b9 (Two Lakhs Fifty Seven thousand Three hundred and Twenty Eight Rupees Only). In the result, The accused is sentenced u/s 255(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months and to pay a fine of 2,57,328/\u00ad(Two Lakhs Fifty Seven thousand Three hundred and Twenty Eight\u20b9 Rupees Only). In default of payment of fine , the accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable under sec 138 of the negotiable instruments act, 1881. The amount of fine , if realized, shall be paid to the complainant as compensation u/s 357(1) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure , 1973. Directly fed into my personal laptop , corrected by me and pronounced in the open court on this the 30th day of November, 2022.
